        <p>Upgrade bears plenty of features that set it apart from other families in the genre. 
        The typeface has its sights firmly set on the future; only a few typical letterforms reference the storied past of the humanist sans model,
        such as the vertex of an M not reaching all the way down to the baseline, or the wide N and O. 
        These earmarks lend elegance to this multipurpose typeface. The lowercase is dynamic and airy, with open apertures and a generous x-height 
        guaranteeing good legibility at any size. And because they’re not overly narrow, Upgrade’s italics look contemporary and are in balance with the upright styles. 
        If one were to map it to the teachings of the legendary Gerrit Noordzij, Upgrade would situate itself on the bottom line of the Noordzij Cube: 
        it’s a forward-looking example of what the master theorized as the low-contrast-translation–sans-serif genre.</p>""",
