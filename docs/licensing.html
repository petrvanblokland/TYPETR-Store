                <h2 class="leading14">Please read this document carefully. We recommend that you print a copy for further reference.</h2>

                <p class="leading14">This End User License Agreement (further referred to as the “Agreement”, “EULA,” “License,” “Agreement”, or “License Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and Buro Petr van Blokland + Claudia Mens VOF (with business registration 27237753 Delft), doing business under the commercial name TYPETR, with a registered business address at Rotterdamseweg 150-d, 2628 AP, Delft, The Netherlands (further referred to as “TYPETR”) and becomes a binding contract between you and Buro Petr van Blokland + Claudia Mens VOF. This Agreement governs the terms of use of the Font Software and the design of the Fonts embodied therein (collectively, “Font Software”), together with any printed materials, media and electronic documentation, updates, add-ons, artworks, web services, mobile services, and any other material that may be associated with the product now or in the future. This Agreement becomes effective (1) when you click on the area marked “[x] I have read and agree to the TYPETR End User license Agreement,” or (2) if you are acquiring Font Software on a compressed archive delivered via e-mail attachment, or a delivery on a CD, DVD, or when you open the package in which the font software is contained. If you do not wish to enter into this Agreement, or if you cannot or do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not purchase, download, install, or access and use the Font Software.</p>

                <ol>
                    <!-- 1. -->
                    <li>Upon payment in full, TYPETR will grant you a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, terminable License to the Font Software that accompanies this EULA. Use of the Font Software is limited to Personal or Internal Business Use only. For the purposes of the License, “Font Software” shall be defined as the design of the Fonts together with the Font Software which, when used generates typeface and typographic designs, symbols, and ornaments. “Personal or Internal Business Use” shall mean Use of the Font Software for your customary, personal, or internal business purposes and, except as may be otherwise permitted herein, shall not mean the commercial distribution or use of Font Software or any component thereof in any Commercial Product whatsoever. You hereby agree that the Font Software shall further comprise all bitmap and/or outline representations of typeface and typographic designs and ornaments created by or derived from the Font Software. The Font Software shall be deemed to include, if applicable, any upgrades, updates, related files, permitted modifications, permitted copies, and related documentation.</li>

                    <!-- 2. -->
                    <li>Every entity - business, organisation, or consumer - that requires access to Font Software must purchase a License in own name prior to using the Font Software. If you are a design company, advertising agency, consultancy, or if you are purchasing this license for use by, or on behalf of, such an entity, or a third-party End User, you must purchase a license appropriate for the intended use of the Font Software by you and the third-party End User. The license granted herein is strictly for use by the license holder – it does not cover or extend to uses by third parties, including but not limited to a subsidiary, affiliate, franchisee, assignee, customer or agent, freelance or independent contractors, or temporary employees using the Font Software in professional environments or for other professional uses. You may not make more copies of the Font Software than the maximum number your license allows. Under the circumstances when a greater number of licenses is required, you, the employer, and/or the ultimate End User are required to purchase additional licenses appropriate for their usage.</li>

                    <!-- 3. -->
                    <li>In this Agreement, “Commercial Product” shall mean, for example only, not limitation, a user-editable electronic document created by use of the Font Software which is then offered for distribution to the public as a Commercial Product in exchange for a separate fee or remuneration. For example only, not limitation, an electronic publication to be distributed for a fee shall be considered a Commercial Product.</li>

                    <!-- 4. -->
                    <li>Except as may be otherwise prohibited herein, you are permitted to electronically distribute a “Personal or Internal Business Use” document (that is, a document other than a Commercial Product as defined above) (i) that is in a static graphic image (for example, a “gif”) or in an embedded electronic document, and (ii) which is distributed in a format that permits only the viewing and printing (and not the editing, altering, enhancing, modifying or extraction of the Font Software) of such static graphic image or an embedded document. Personal or Internal Business Use shall not include any use of the Font Software by persons that are not members of your immediate household, or your authorised employees. All such users shall be notified by you as to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.</li>

                    <!-- 5. -->
                    <li>TYPETR, including its successors and its assigns, do retain all right, title and interest in and to the Font Software together with the design of the Font embodied therein together with any trademarks used in connection therewith. Except where otherwise expressly permitted herein, you agree not to copy the Font Software or create derivative typeface design works and/or font software based upon the design of the Font or the Font Software. You agree that the unauthorised use of the design of the Font and/or the Font Software represents an infringement of TYPETR’s exclusive rights causing significant monetary harm. You also agree that such damages cannot be readily estimated and TYPETR shall be entitled to seek a restraining order to prevent any unauthorised uses. In the event of infringement, TYPETR’s rights and remedies shall be cumulative.</li>

                    <!-- 6. -->
                    <li>You are not allowed to alter the Font Software or the designs embodied therein in any possible way. Creating, generating, or converting the Font Software into additional or other formats, or into files intended for use in other operating systems, is expressly prohibited. You are not allowed to perform character set subsetting: customised subsetted variants of the Font Software may only be created by TYPETR on request, as a paid service. Any alterations or amendments to the naming and/or embedding bits characteristics of the Font Software is expressly prohibited. The Font Software may not be used to create or distribute any electronic document in which the Font Software, or any part thereof, is embedded in a format that permits editing, alterations, enhancements, or modifications or extraction of the Font Software by the recipient. You agree not to facilitate or transmit any electronic document to any parties that intend to edit, alter, enhance, modify, “hack,” or otherwise remove the Font Software.</li>

                    <!-- 7. -->
                    <li>You may make two (2) backup copies of Font Software for archival purposes only, and you agree to retain exclusive custody and control over any such copy. Upon termination of the Agreement, you must destroy the original and any and all copies of the Font Software. Uploading the Font Software to GitHub repositories is expressly prohibited and represents unauthorised sharing and distribution of the Font Software. The unauthorised sharing, distribution, assignment, sub-licensing, lending, renting, sale and re-sale, or other unauthorised use or misuse of the backup copy, represents a material breach of this Agreement and will result in the immediate termination of this License.</li>

                    <!-- 8. -->
                    <li>The design of the Font, the Font Software and any trademarks associated therewith are the exclusive property of TYPETR and are protected by the copyright and other intellectual property law of The Netherlands, as well as by the international copyright and design laws and international treaties.</li>

                    <!-- 9. -->
                    <li>You expressly agree not to modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, alter, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Font Software. Other jurisdictions may provide for additional rights, and if applicable, you may reverse engineer or decompile the Font Software only to the extent that sufficient information is not available for the purpose of creating an interoperable software program (but only for such purpose and only to the extent that sufficient information is not provided by TYPETR upon written request). All trademarks shall be used in accepted trademark practice, including identification of the trademark owner’s name. Use of the trademarks associated with the Font Software inures solely to the benefit of TYPETR. You may not change any trademark or trade name designation for the licensed Font Software.</li>

                    <!-- 10. -->

                    <!-- 11. -->
                    <li>In order to obtain a license upgrade, you must contact TYPETR via <a href="#" onclick="this.href='mailto:' + 'sales' + '@' + 'typetr.com'">sales [at] typetr.com</a> for more information. If you are unsure whether your use of the Font Software is specifically permitted under this Agreement, please contact TYPETR.</li>

                    <!-- 12. -->
                    <li>Embedding of the Fonts in a print/preview format is permitted. Notwithstanding, embedding or other use of the Fonts or the outlines thereof in any method which permits the extraction of the Font Software of the designs embodied therein is expressly prohibited. Any such use requires the express written permission of TYPETR and may or may not require the purchase of a license upgrade at the sole discretion of TYPETR.</li>

                    <!-- 13. -->
                    <li>In the event any symbols, ideographs, dingbats or other art forms are part of the Font Software, use of the artwork is further restricted. You may use the artwork, drawings and/or dingbats on goods for sale, in logo design, retail packaging or in point-of-sale uses only after the purchase of a license upgrade.</li>

                    <!-- 14. -->
                    <li>Embedded Electronic Devices include the use of the Font Software for any on-screen display or on an electronic device outside a single (1) location. For example, and not by way of limitation, such electronic devices include kiosks, gaming devices, embroidery or sewing machines. The Font Software may be embedded and resident within an electronic device provided it cannot be extracted from the device. This restriction does not apply to laptop/notebook computers which are defined as a standard device in this Desktop Font Software License Agreement.</li>

                    <!-- 15. -->
                    <li>The Font Software is licensed for perpetual use by a specific number of computing devices registered in the Sales Invoice accompanying this EULA. Use of the Font Software in more than one geographic location is permitted provided that each geographic location, computing device or potential computing device is licensed. You are not entitled to a refund, offset or other adjustments in the event of a reduction in the number of computing devices or a reduction of the number of geographic locations. Should you opt to upload the Font Software to your Adobe Creative Cloud account for serving multiple computing devices, you must first ensure the maximum number of computing devices linked to your Adobe Creative Cloud do correspond with the maximum number of computing devices allowed by your Desktop license. Under the circumstances when a greater number of licenses is required, you are required to purchase additional licenses appropriate for your usage. You agree that the installation of Font Software on a greater total number of computing devices than the maximum number your license allows - including but not limited to the installation of Font Software on your computing devices via Adobe Creative Cloud - represents an unauthorised use of the Font Software.</li>

                    <!-- 16. -->
                    <li>Except as may be otherwise expressly provided for herein, you expressly agree not to rent, lease, sublicense, give, lend, donate, or further distribute the Font Software - fully or in part. You may not transfer your rights under this Agreement - fully or in part - to another person or entity (including but not limited to: ) at any time. Any transfer in violation of this provision will be null and void from inception.</li>

                    <!-- 17. -->
                    <li>All sales of Font Software are final. The Font Software may not be returned, exchanged, or refunded.</li>

                    <!-- 18. -->
                    <li>TYPETR warrants that the Font Software will perform substantially in accordance with its documentation for ninety (90) days following delivery of the Font Software. To make a warranty claim, you must return the Font Software to the online provider you acquired it from, together with a copy of your invoice and sufficient information regarding your acquisition of the Font Software to permit the confirmation of the effective date of this License. TYPETR hereby EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, express and implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. TYPETR does not warrant that the operation of the font software will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that the font software is without defects. Under no circumstances shall TYPETR be liable to you or any other party, for any damages (including but not limited to special, consequential, incidental damages, lost profits, savings or business interruption as a result of the use of the font software even if notified in advance of such possibility. You hereby agree that your entire, exclusive, and cumulative liability and remedy shall be limited to the cost of the Font Software or replacement thereof, either of each remaining at TYPETR’s discretion. Under no circumstances shall TYPETR’s liability to you exceed either the refunding of the cost of the Font Software or replacement of the Font Software, either of which shall be at TYPETR’s sole discretion. The terms of this Agreement are contractual in nature.</li>

                    <!-- 19. -->
                    <li>Consumers only: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, special damages, or implied warranties. Any implied warranty or other right created by law is only effective for the shortest warranty period allowed by law. No warranties or conditions of any kind apply thereafter. In the alternative and to the extent permissible by law, you agree that all implied warranties are not to be effective for more than thirty (30) days.</li>

                    <!-- 20. -->
                    <li>You expressly agree that this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of The Netherlands, as they apply to contracts wholly performed therein and without respect to its conflict of laws provisions or the conflict of laws provisions of any other jurisdiction. You expressly accept the jurisdiction of the courts in the District of The Hague, The Netherlands. You hereby also expressly agree that the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</li>

                    <!-- 21. -->
                    <li>This Agreement may, at TYPETR’s sole discretion, be enforced by an authorised agent acting on its behalf.</li>

                    <!-- 22. -->
                    <li>To the extent that any law, statute, treaty, or governmental regulation shall be deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to provide you with additional or different rights from those provided herein. Such rights are determined to be deemed non-waivable as a matter of law and to supersede the rights or any limitations specifically provided herein. Then such law, statute, treaty, or governmental regulation shall be deemed to be made a part of the Agreement. To the extent that any such rights created by any law, statute, treaty, or governmental regulation are waivable, you agree that your acceptance of the Agreement shall constitute an effective and irrevocable waiver of any such right.</li>

                    <!-- 23. -->

This Agreement becomes effective (1) when you click on the area marked “[x] I have read and agree to the TYPETR End User license Agreement,” or (2) if you are acquiring Font Software on a compressed archive delivered via e-mail attachment, or a delivery on a CD, DVD, or when you open the package in which the font software is contained. If you do not wish to enter into this Agreement, or if you cannot or do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not purchase, download, install, or access and use the Font Software.</p>

If you wish to use and/or install the TYPETR Font Software on your desktop or personal computer or on a server for use and access by a desktop or personal computing device, you must secure a separate license appropriate for such intended use. You further agree to exercise reasonable care to avoid unauthorised distribution of the Font Software.</li>

                    <li>The Font Software will be transmitted for your use in the Web Open Font Format (“WOFF”) format and/or such other formats as TYPETR may determine or otherwise agree, at its discretion.</li>

                    <!-- 3. -->
                    <li>This non-exclusive, revocable license grants you limited rights to use the Font Software to style HTML and SVG documents using the CSS @font-face mechanism.

A page view is defined as a request to load a page that references the Font Software via the CSS @font-face mechanism. If the maximum number of allowed page views is exceeded, an additional license, or license upgrade is required. TYPETR reserves the right to request, and you hereby agree to provide, a detailed analytics report (issued by Google analytics or an equivalent service) displaying the maximum monthly page view counts of your licensed domain name within seven calendar days of the request date. Such license compliance verification requests by TYPETR may be carried out no more than twice per calendar year.</li>
