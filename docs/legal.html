                            <li>You are an individual.</li>

            <li>

                    <li>If there is any conflict or ambiguity between the terms of the documents listed in clause 3.1 [???????] a term contained in a document higher in the list shall have priority over one contained in a document lower in the list.</li>
                    <li><b>If you purchase more than once Product Licence from our website, a separate Contract shall apply to each Product Licence purchased.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Read the product details and the EULA for each Product carefully, as they contain important terms and information.</b> When you click on a Product to learn more about a particular Product, you will be taken to a product page, which contains a hyperlink to the relevant EULA. The EULA for each Foundry, and for each Product, may be different. If you would like to purchase a Product Licence, it is your responsibility to carefully read the details about the Product on the product page, and its EULA, and to decide whether or not to proceed. Once you purchase the Product Licence you will enter into a legally binding contract for the Product on an “as is” basis under the Contract Terms.</li>
                    <li><b>Completing the Usage Specification.</b> You will be able to select the weight or style of the Product, where and how it will be used, and the type of licence (annual or perpetual) at the point of placing your order, and this will make up the detail contained within the Usage Specification.

Once you purchase the Product Licence you will enter into a legally binding contract with us under the Contract Terms which incorporate the Usage Specification.</li>
                    <li><b>Placing your order.</b> When you place an order for a Product Licence via our website and click on “PAY NOW”, [?????????] you are making an offer to purchase the Product Licence on the Contract Terms. Once you click “PAY NOW” [?????????] you will be offering to enter into a contract with us for the chosen Product on an “as is” basis, and under the terms of the Contract (which incorporates the EULA and the Usage Specification).</li>
                    <li><b>How we will accept your order.</b> Acceptance of your order will take place when we send you a link to download the Product (“Commencement of Contract”) at which point a legally binding contract will come into existence between you and us on the Contract Terms.</li>
                    <li><b>Once you download the Product, you waive your right to change your mind.</b> Once your order has been accepted, the Contract between you and us will be performed immediately and you will waive any rights you may have had as a consumer to withdraw from the Contract once you have begun to download or stream the Product.</li>
                    <li><b>Businesses.</b> In using our Services on behalf of a business, corporate entity, or other organisation (“Business”) then you represent and warrant that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>you are an authorized representative of the Business with the authority to bind the Business to these terms; and</li>
                            <li>you agree to these terms on the Business’s behalf.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>If you are a Business this is our entire agreement with you.</b> If you are a Business the Contract constitutes the entire agreement between us in relation to our Services. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise, representation, assurance, or warranty made or given by or on behalf of us which is not set out in these terms and that you shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in the Contract.</li>
                    <li><b>If your order cannot be accepted.</b> If your order cannot be accepted, we will inform you of this in writing and will not charge you for the Product Licence.

            </li>
        </ol>
When we will provide the Product. After you have paid for the Product Licence we will provide you with a link from which you can download the Product.
We are not responsible for delays outside our control. If the Product is not available for download due to an event outside our control, then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. We will not be liable for delays caused by any such event.
What will happen if you do not give required information to us. We may need certain information from you so that we can supply the Product and the Product Licence to you, for example, when we create an Account for you. If you do not give us this information, or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information, we may (a) suspend or close your Account; (b) suspend or terminate your Product Licence; (c) end the Contract (and clause 10 will apply); (d) make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible for supplying the Product or the Product Licence late, or not supplying any part of it if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.
Once you download the Product, you waive your right to change your mind. Once your order has been accepted, the Contract will be performed immediately and you will waive any rights you may have had as a consumer to withdraw from the Contract once you have begun to download or stream the Product.
Our rights to make changes
Minor changes to the products. We may change the Product or Product Licence:
to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; and
to implement minor technical adjustments and improvements, for example to address a security threat.
More significant changes to the Products or to the Contract. In addition, we may make more significant changes to the Contract or to the Products or Product Licences, but if we do so we will make reasonable efforts to notify you.
Updates to the Product. We may update or require you to update the Product, provided that the Product shall always match the description of it that we provided to you before you bought it.
Term and termination
The Contract shall, unless otherwise terminated as provided in this clause 8, commence on the Contract Start Date and shall continue:
(if an annual licence) for 365 calendar days from the Contract Start Date;
(if a perpetual licence) on an ongoing basis;
or until otherwise terminated in accordance with these Terms.

Our rights to end the Contract
We may end the Contract if you break it. We may end the Contract between us at any time by writing to you if:
you do not, within a reasonable time of us asking for it, provide us with information that is necessary for us to open an Account or to provide our Services or the Product to you;
you breach any of the Contract Terms, or otherwise use (or directly or indirectly allow others to use) the Product outside the scope of the EULA or the Usage Specification;
we have reason to believe that you are using, or permitting others to use, the Product without an appropriate Product Licence in place.
You must compensate us if you break the Contract. If we end the Contract in the situations set out in clause 9.1 we may charge you reasonable compensation for the costs and any loss of revenue we will incur as a result of your breaking the Contract.
We may withdraw the Product. We may write to you to let you know that we, or the relevant Foundry, are going to withdraw the Product and that the Product Licence has been terminated.

all licences granted under the Contract shall immediately terminate and you shall immediately cease all use of the Product;
you shall [upon request] destroy or otherwise dispose of any copies of the Product;
you shall [upon request] use best endeavours to procure that all third parties who whom you have either provided or (directly or indirectly) allowed to use the Product immediately cease all use of the Product and destroy or otherwise dispose of any copies of the Product;
any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities of the parties that have accrued up to the date of termination, including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the Contract which existed at or before the date of termination shall not be affected or prejudiced.
The termination or ending of the Contract shall not of itself give rise to any liability on the part of us to pay any compensation to you for loss of profits or goodwill, to reimburse you for any costs relating to or resulting from such termination, or for any other loss or damage.
Warranties.

Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you if you are a CONSUMER

We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so.
We are responsible to you as a consumer for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with the Contract Terms, we are responsible to you if you are a consumer for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking the Contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the Contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process. To the extent permitted by law, our liability to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us is subject to the limitations set out in this clause 16.
When we are liable for damage caused by defective digital content. If you are a consumer and defective digital content (other than the Product itself) which we have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you, and this is caused by our failure to use reasonable care and skill we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation, subject always to clause 16.7. However, we will not be liable for damage which you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge or for damage which was caused by you failing to correctly follow instructions or to have in place the minimum system requirements advised by us.
We are not liable for any loss or damage caused by the Product(s) sold on our website. To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable to you for any loss or damages arising under or in connection with the Product, which is sold to you on an “as is” basis. If you identify an issue with the Product within 30 days of purchasing the same, you should notify us and provided that we are notified within those first 30 days we may, at our complete discretion, take reasonable steps to replace or otherwise repair the Product.
We are not liable for business losses. If you are a consumer, we only supply our Services to you for domestic and private use. If you use our Services for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose our liability to you will be limited as set out in clause 17.
Limit on our liability. Subject to clause 16.2, I Love Typography Ltd’s total aggregate liability in contract (including in respect of the indemnity at clause 15), tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty howsoever arising), misrepresentation (whether innocent or negligent), restitution or otherwise, arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of the Contract shall be limited to the total Licence Fee actually paid by you to us for the Product during the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the claim arose.
Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you if you are a BUSINESS
We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so.
To the extent permitted by law, and except where expressly and specifically provided in these Terms:
all warranties, representations, conditions and all other terms of any kind whatsoever implied or that could be implied by statute or common law in relation to the Product or our Services are, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, excluded; and
the Product is provided to you on an "as is" basis.
Exclusions to the extent of our liability. Except as expressly and specifically provided in these Terms, and subject always to clause 17.1:
We exclude all implied conditions, warranties, representations or other terms that may apply to our Services, our website or any content on it.
We will not be liable to you for any loss or damage, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, even if foreseeable, arising under or in connection with:
use of, or inability to use, our website or our Services; or
use of or reliance on any content displayed on our website;
any defective digital content; or
the Products sold on our website.
In particular, we will not be liable for:
loss of profits, sales, business, or revenue;
business interruption;
loss of anticipated savings;
loss of business opportunity, goodwill or reputation; or
any indirect or consequential loss or damage.
Cap on our liability. Subject to clause 17.1, I Love Typography Ltd’s total aggregate liability in contract (including in respect of the indemnity at clause 15), tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty howsoever arising), misrepresentation (whether innocent or negligent), restitution or otherwise, arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of the Contract shall be limited to the total Licence Fee actually paid by you to us for the Product during the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the claim arose.
Which country's laws apply to any disputes?
Consumers. If you are a consumer, please note that the Contract Terms, their subject matter, and their formation, are governed by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction except that if you are a consumer resident of Northern Ireland, you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.
Businesses. If you are a Business, the Contract Terms, their subject matter, and their formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by English law. We both agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
Other important terms
We may transfer the Contract to someone else. We may transfer our rights and obligations under the Contract to another organisation.
You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else (except that you can always transfer our guarantee). You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under the Contract to another person if we agree to this in writing.
Nobody else has any rights under the Contract. With the exception of clause 4 (The Licence) and clause 3 (Our Contract with you) of these Terms, and the EULA, no other person shall have any rights to enforce any of the Contract Terms, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise. The Foundry for the Product reserves the right to rely upon and where appropriate enforce clause 4 and clause 9 of these Terms and the EULA.
If a court finds part of the Contract illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of the Contract Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
Even if we delay in enforcing the Contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under the Contract, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking the Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.

To operate our Service and provide You with our Service.
To provide You with support and to respond to Your inquiries, including to investigate and address Your concerns and monitor and improve our Service.
To fulfill or meet the reason You provided the information. For example, if You share Your contact information to ask a question about our Service, We will use that personal information to respond to Your inquiry. If You provide Your personal information to purchase a product or service, We will use that information to process Your payment and facilitate delivery.
To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.
As described to You when collecting Your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.
For internal administrative and auditing purposes.
To detect security incidents and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, including, when necessary, to prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Please note that the examples provided above are illustrative and not intended to be exhaustive. For more details on how we use this information, please refer to the "Use of Your Personal Data" section.

If We decide to collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information We collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes We will update this Privacy Policy.

Disclosure of Personal Information for Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes

We may use or disclose and may have used or disclosed in the last twelve (12) months the following categories of personal information for business or commercial purposes:

Category A: Identifiers
Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))
Category D: Commercial information
Category F: Internet or other similar network activity
Please note that the categories listed above are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of personal information were in fact disclosed, but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information from the applicable category may be and may have been disclosed.

When We disclose personal information for a business purpose or a commercial purpose, We enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.

Sale of Personal Information

As defined in the CCPA, "sell" and "sale" mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by the business to a third party for valuable consideration. This means that We may have received some kind of benefit in return for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary benefit.

Please note that the categories listed below are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of personal information were in fact sold, but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information from the applicable category may be and may have been shared for value in return.

We may sell and may have sold in the last twelve (12) months the following categories of personal information:

Category A: Identifiers
Category B: Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))

Service Providers
Payment processors

Third party vendors to whom You or Your agents authorize Us to disclose Your personal information in connection with products or services We provide to You
Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age

We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 16 through our Service, although certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and instruct their children to never provide information on other websites without their permission.

We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless We receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.

If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or 16) has provided Us with personal information, please contact Us with sufficient detail to enable Us to delete that information.
