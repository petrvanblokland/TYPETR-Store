                            <li>These Terms;</li>
                            <li>The Usage Specification; and</li>
                            <li>The EULA for the Product;</li>

                        <p>(together, the “Contract Terms”).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>If there is any conflict or ambiguity between the terms of the documents listed in clause 3.1  a term contained in a document higher in the list shall have priority over one contained in a document lower in the list.</li>

Once you purchase the Product Licence you will enter into a legally binding contract for the Product on an “as is” basis under the Contract Terms.</li>
                    <li><b>Completing the Usage Specification.</b> You will be able to select the weight or style of the Product, where and how it will be used, and the type of licence (annual or perpetual) at the point of placing your order, and this will make up the detail contained within the Usage Specification.

                    <li><b>Placing your order.</b> When you place an order for a Product Licence via our website and click on “PAY”, you are making an offer to purchase the Product Licence on the Contract Terms. Once you click “PAY” you will be offering to enter into a contract with us for the chosen Product on an “as is” basis, and under the terms of the Contract (which incorporates the EULA and the Usage Specification).</li>
                    <li><b>How we will accept your order.</b> Acceptance of your order will take place when we send you a link to download the Product (“Commencement of Contract”) at which point a legally binding contract will come into existence between you and us on the Contract Terms.</li>
                    <li><b>Once you download the Product, you waive your right to change your mind.</b> Once your order has been accepted, the Contract between you and us will be performed immediately and you will waive any rights you may have had as a consumer to withdraw from the Contract once you have begun to download or stream the Product.</li>
                    <li><b>Businesses.</b> In using our Services on behalf of a business, corporate entity, or other organisation (“Business”) then you represent and warrant that:

You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement, promise, representation, assurance, or warranty made or given by or on behalf of us which is not set out in these terms and that you shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in the Contract.</li>
                    <li><b>If your order cannot be accepted.</b> If your order cannot be accepted, we will inform you of this in writing and will not charge you for the Product Licence. This might be because the chosen Product Licence or Product is no longer available, because there is an issue with your payment, or because we have identified an error in the price or description of the chosen Product Licence or Product.</li>
                    <li><b>Your order number.</b> Once your order has been accepted, you will be given an order number. You should keep your order number safe, as it will help us to identify your order if ever you contact us.</li>
                    <li><b>Products may vary slightly from their pictures and descriptions.</b>The images of the Products as shown on our website are for illustrative purposes only.

            </li>
            <li><b>Which country's laws apply to any disputes?</b>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Consumers.</b> If you are a consumer, please note that the Contract Terms, their subject matter, and their formation, are governed by Dutch (The Netherlands) law. You and we both agree that the courts of The Netherlands have exclusive jurisdiction.</li>
                    <li><b>Businesses.</b> If you are a Business, the Contract Terms, their subject matter, and their formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by Dutch (The Netherlands) law. We both agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of The Netherlands.</li>

                    <li><b>Nobody else has any rights under the Contract.</b> With the exception of clause 4  (The Licence) and clause 3 (Our Contract with you) of these Terms, and the EULA, no other person shall have any rights to enforce any of the Contract Terms, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise. The Foundry for the Product reserves the right to rely upon and where appropriate enforce clause 4 and clause 9 of these Terms and the EULA.</li>
                    <li><b>If a court finds part of the Contract illegal, the rest will continue in force.</b> Each of the paragraphs of the Contract Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</li>
                    <li>Even if we delay in enforcing the Contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under the Contract, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking the Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</li>
